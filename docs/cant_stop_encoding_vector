Can't Stop
State Encoding for RL:

Board State: Flatten the board state into a single vector.
 Each cell state can be one-hot encoded, resulting in a three-dimensional vector per cell
  (i.e., [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], or [0, 0, 1]). Concatenate these vectors for all cells.

Dice Values: Use a one-hot encoding for each dice value.
 Since each dice can take a value from 1-6, this results in a six-dimensional vector for each dice.
  Concatenate these vectors for all four dice.

Current Player: A simple binary value indicating the current player.

Action Encoding for RL:

Actions in "Can't Stop" involve selecting a pair of dice combinations.
 One way to encode this is to assign a unique ID to each possible pair combination.
  This means the output layer of your neural network would have as many neurons as there are possible pair combinations.<<<
